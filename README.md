- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MrColugo (Ayache, N.K.)
- ðŸ‘€ 
I am graduated in Mining Engineering by the Centro de EducaÃ§Ã£o TecnolÃ³gico de Minas Gerais, I have already worked in several activities of research and development of Artificial Intelligence applications applied to mining and geotechnology.  Experience in areas related to mining as geotechnical, geostatistics, planning and mineral processing.

- ðŸŒ± I am looking to expand my knowledge in the area of Machine Learning in order to develop new applications of this technology in my professional field.

# Slope-stability-study-with-Decision-Tree-and-Random-Forests-
Aiming to study the effect of 18 geotechnical variables on the overall stability of a slope, different models are evaluated in this research, the general model (with all variables); a mathematical model (with variables selected from their importance, using Random Forest, to choose the variables in order to target slope stability); two expert models using variables applied in classification systems. The model validation was done through the test sample, using bootstrap and partition confusion matrices aiming at the reproducibility of the results. A study of the errors using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) allowed the identification of samples inconsistent with the others, so the models were remade and compared with the previous ones.  This way the best modeling was found based on the variables selected by Random Forest with the database without the problematic samples.
